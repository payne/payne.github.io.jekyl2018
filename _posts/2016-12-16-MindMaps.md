[David Richard](http://drichard.org/) wrote amazing mindmaps software.  It was very easy to build and deploy a copy to a 
[gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) branch.

One of the manythings I like about David's software is the json export and import.

My frozen in time build is at [MattPayne.org/mindmaps](http://mattpayne.org/mindmaps/)

What do you like for mind mapping?
